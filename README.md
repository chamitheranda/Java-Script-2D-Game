# Java-Script-2D-Game
I named this game as a **_"ALIEN RUN"_**. It has one alien he can run and jump . <br>
He go forward to find his friend once he find his friend he will win . <br>
While run forward he should pass flames which come to him oterwise he will dead and should start the game from begining .<br>
